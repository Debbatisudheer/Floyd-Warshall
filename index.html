        <h1>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h1>
        <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). It works for both directed and undirected graphs.</p>
        <h2>Algorithm Details:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Time Complexity: O(V^3)</li>
            <li>Space Complexity: O(V^2)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the provided graph, we have taken 5 nodes labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. These nodes are connected by 7 directed edges with weights assigned to them.</p>
